LinkedList.java is a code that allows user to input their own values for a linked list. \n
Creating the code to make a linked list is relatively straight-forward using classes.
User input is taken through java.util.Scanner, and I have attempted to try/catch exceptions of incorrect type arguments. The user is able to decide when they want the list to end, and the list will then print starting with the head.
